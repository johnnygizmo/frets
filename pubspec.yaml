# The following section is specific to Flutter packages.
flutter:

  # To add assets to your package, add an assets section, like this:

  # For details regarding assets in packages, see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/asset-from-package
  #
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/to/resolution-aware-images

  # To add custom fonts to your package, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Leland
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Leland.otf
    - family: LelandText
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/LelandText.otf
    - family: MuseJazz
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/MuseJazz.otf
    - family: MuseJazzText
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/MuseJazzText.otf
